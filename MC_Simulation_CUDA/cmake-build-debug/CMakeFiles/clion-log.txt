CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:18 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindQt5Network.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "Qt5Network", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Network" with
  any of the following names:

    Qt5NetworkConfig.cmake
    qt5network-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Qt5Network" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Qt5Network_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "Qt5Network" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
